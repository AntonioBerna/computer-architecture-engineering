# RC4 Encryption/Decryption Algorithm

The tutor was feeling good and therefore decided to provide the C code that implements RC4, however the code was completed!

Your task is to complete the `src/lib.c` file by implementing your own version of the `memcpy` and `strlen` library functions, and then translate the `C` code into `x86_64 Assembly`.

The resulting `Assembly` code must conform to the source `C` code, so:

1. The difference between local and global variables must be maintained;
2. You can't define functions that aren't already defined in the `C` code;
3. You must implement all the functions of the provided `C` code in `Assembly`.

To test the correctness of `C` code and `Assembly` code, you can use [https://www.lddgo.net/en/encrypt/rc4](https://www.lddgo.net/en/encrypt/rc4).
