# :detective: â€‹Reversing

For this task you will have to translate a program written in z64 Assembly into its equivalent in C. The program will be automatically tested with valid and invalid inputs, to verify that its behavior is correct. In addition, a simple [linter](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) will be used to evaluate the quality of your code.

The assembly code that you need to convert to C is contained in the file `reverse-me.asm`. This file can also be opened with the simulator [z64sim](https://github.com/alessandropellegrini/z64sim), to inspect its functioning. It is important to note, however, that the input to the program is passed by the operating system, which is not present in the simulator: if you run it inside the simulator, it will not receive any input.

The reconstructed C program code must be placed inside the file `reversed.c`. Inside this file there is the signature of the `main` function and a minimal implementation (it does nothing) that allows the program to be compiled anyway. The content of the `main` must be modified to adapt it to the operation of `reverse-me.asm`.

There is also a `Makefile` in the repository. This file can be used by invoking the `make` program on the command line, to generate the executable `a.out` that you can test locally. The solution is compiled using the `Makefile`. You must not delete or modify this file.

## How to make the program

> [!TIP]
> As with all other tasks, it is recommended to approach the problem in stages. The program in `reverse-me.asm` contains several functions. You can focus on one function at a time and then try to glue the overall solution together.
