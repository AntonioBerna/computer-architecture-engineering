## mini docs

Inside the `C/` directory there are no build files, such as `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt` or for the more nostalgic `build.sh`, this is because I recently created the `roma` software to compile projects anywhere on your computer.

For more information about the `roma` software and how to install it click [here](https://github.com/AntonioBerna/roma).
