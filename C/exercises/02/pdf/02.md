## Requirements to implement

Write a program in `C` language capable of performing the $4$ operations between two real numbers entered from the keyboard.

After the two numbers, called $A$ and $B$, have been entered, the program must display the four values $A + B$, $A - B$, $A \cdot B$ and $\frac{A}{B}$.

Assume that $B \neq 0$.
