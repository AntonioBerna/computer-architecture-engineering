## Requirements to implement

Write a program in `C` language to solve quadratic equations.

In particular, given a generic quadratic equation of the form $a \cdot x^2 + b \cdot x + c = 0$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are known real coefficients and $x$ represents the unknown, the program determines the two roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ of the given equation, where they exist.

Identify all the special cases ($a = 0$, $\Delta \leq 0$, ...) and print the appropriate information messages.
